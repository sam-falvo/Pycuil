Python Console User Interface Library.
Rhymes with Nyquil.

Textual/console interfaces are an abandoned afterthought for most applications these days.
Widget libraries exist, but tend to be burdensome to use.
Consider, many console tools exist just to scratch an itch;
and are not intended to be the well thought out, research-backed, polished solutions we expect GUI apps to be.
But, that doesn't mean we don't want our console tools to lack a nice interface as well.
It's just that the cost of implementing nice interfaces for console applications is frequently too high to justify that investment.

The goal of this library is to make supporting console user interfaces as simple as calling `print`,
which is something many have observed about so-called
[immediate-mode GUIs](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0001).
So, I figured I'd use the IMGUI idea to build a console user interface library that I'm comfortable with.

Hopefully, you'll find it as comfortable as I do.
